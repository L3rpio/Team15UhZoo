In our web application, we have 4 user authentication types. Customer, Employee, Manager, and Admin. 
Customer and Employee can only edit their own usernames and passwords in their respetive portals.
In addition, customers can buy tickets and foods from their customer portal page. 
Manager can edit their own inforomation and the information about their employees.
Admins can access all employee, customer, and work pllace data. They also have access to 2 data reports. 
The first data report allows the admin to search up customers by their first name, last name, and when they signed up with us.
The second data report allows the admin to search up employees by their first name, last name, wage, and when they were hired.
